Currently in this rendition there is no way to win
or a way to place down turrets, this is an older build
that i had to force to build.

The ships randomly spawn and will follow the path to
the end point.

Being honest, after the assignment was finished I went back
and finished it up with a friend just to satisfy myself. 
This nor the uploaded version shows that. 
I apologize but this is all that I have.
